Visual Math Worksheet Generator

A simple web application built with Python and Flask to generate engaging, downloadable PDF math worksheets for Kindergarten and First Grade Students.

This tool is designed to help young learners bridge the gap between abstract numbers and concrete quantities by using a colorful, visual bar method.


üåü Features

Visual Learning: Each number (0-10) is paired with a corresponding number of colorful vertical bars (e.g., 5 is |||||) to aid in counting.

Engaging Design:

Numbers and bars are colored to make learning more fun.

Adjacent problems use different color pairs to keep the page visually interesting.

Each page features a friendly, colorful flower border.

Customizable Worksheets:

Choose between Addition (+) or Subtraction (-).

Select 1 Page (18 problems) or 2 Pages (36 problems).

Smart Subtraction: The "top number >= bottom number" rule is automatically applied to subtraction problems to prevent negative answers.

PDF Download: Generates a high-quality, print-ready PDF document with one click.
